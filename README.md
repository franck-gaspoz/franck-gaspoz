### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  
- ðŸ”­I'm currently working on a command shell cli tool using C# Net Core :

<img src="robotazteque.png" align="top" style="float:left;margin-right:8px"/> | <b>Orbital Shell</b> is a multi-plateform (**windows, linux, macos, arm**) command shell (according to .Net Core supported platforms and APIs compatibilities), inspired by <b><i>bash</i></b> and **POSIX** recommendations.<br><br>It provides any usual bash shell feature (even if modernized) and 'user friendly' syntaxes allowing to access (get/set/call) C# objects.<br><br>Developed using **C# 8, .NET Core 3.1/Net 5 and .NET Standard 2.1**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;

This shell integrates the <u>most usefull shell commands</u>, and is intented to be extended by coding new commands or downloading new commands modules within a repository of modules. Of course it can be enterly customized by using the features integrated to the shell (<u>scripts, functions, commands, aliases, settings, parametrization,...</u>). Having a strong <u>ANSI/VT-100-220-300-500</u> support, it provides structured and colorized display of data and information (support of <u>ASCII, Unicode and 24 bits colors</u>).

- ðŸ˜„ Iâ€™m looking for **collaborators** ðŸ‘¯ to help for evolving this tool ! If you **like** the **command line**, the **bash** syntax, programming **cli tools**, **parsers**, **data streams**, ANSI, C# 8, batch, and so on... you may like to develop orbital shell! Any idea, suggest, code, feedback is welcomed ! You can directly **FORK** the project @ [https://github.com/franck-gaspoz/orbital-shell.git](https://github.com/franck-gaspoz/orbital-shell.git) and start developing to prepare your first pull request, it will be well received. You can also peek **an issue** and start working on. We can contact ðŸ’¬ by mail, skype and so on...

  *Warning: due to the average age of our main contributors, this project might contains **vintage** architecture,design and code. Nevertheless the source code is intensively based on young timers preferred patterns, C# 8 language usage (intellisense agrees), and it pretends to fit to good practices and architecture guidelines.*
